"""
Job execution engine.

One path for every job regardless of origin — HTTP trigger, in-process
chain, or the recovery poll loop:

  start_job(row) → claim_job() atomically flips queued/error → processing
                 → exactly one worker wins → handler runs as a strongly-
                   referenced background task.

Because chained jobs are inserted as 'queued' rows before they run, a crash
at any point leaves either a 'queued' row (recovered by the poll loop) or a
'processing' row (marked errored by the startup reaper) — never a silently
lost in-memory task.
